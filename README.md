**Kitschpatrol's Homebrew Tap. Odds and ends.**

<!-- /description -->

## Usage

`brew install kitschpatrol/stuff/<formula>`

Or `brew tap kitschpatrol/stuff` and then `brew install <formula>`.

For help, see `brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

## Implementation notes

### Repository structure

Originally based on [`brew tap-new`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.md).

`Casks/custom` - Casks not available elsewhere

`Casks/fork` - Forks of casks otherwise available in [`homebrew/core`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core)

`Casks/pinned` - Legacy casks formerly available in [`homebrew/core`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core)

### Tap precedence

There [doesn't seem to be a good way](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/24238) to prefer one tap's formulae or casks over another's, so the "pinned" formulae / casks are given unique names.

### Taking sha256

```sh
shasum -a 256 ./YourApp.zip | sed 's/ .*//' | pbcopy
```

### Checking for cask updates

```sh
brew bump --tap kitschpatrol/stuff
```
