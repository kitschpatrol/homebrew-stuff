# Kitschpatrol Stuff

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install kitschpatrol/stuff/<formula>`

Or `brew tap kitschpatrol/stuff` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Tap precedence

There [doesn't seem to be a good way](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/24238) to prefer one tap's formulae or casks over another's, so the "pinned" formulae / casks are given unique names.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
